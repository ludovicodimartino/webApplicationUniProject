\begin{description}
	\item[Di Martino Ludovico] Mockup of the web application using Figma. Admin servlet: insert car, insert circuit, insert car type, insert circuit type, edit car, edit circuit. The useful DAOs for the Admin servlet: The resource objects for the Admin servlet.
	\item[Galli Filippo] In this project my primary focus was on developing the homepage management and user operations. This involved implementing components such as the UserServlet and the HomeServlet, as well as crafting corresponding JSP pages (such as login.jsp, signup.jsp, userPage.jsp and home.jsp), implementing the UserRegisterDAO, the UserLoginDAO, and the GetUserByEmailDAO. Additionally, I developed the LoginFilter and the HomeFilter. I have also partially contributed in the shaping of the Entity-Relationship schema and the error code infrastructure.
	\item[Leonardi Alessandro] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

	\item[Rigobello Manuel] In this project, I contributed to the creation and development of the Entity-Relationship schema, the relational schema, to the population of the tables and to the triggers. Then, I started to develop the order page, which includes the jsp page (for the second homework I will improve the flow of creating an order by including the client-side part), the ListCarByAvailabilityDAO, the ListCircuitByCarType, the InsertOrderDAO for inserting the new order into the table, the recap page and the OrderServlet that handles the different url. Next, I developed some rest api. In particular, I started with the dispatcher for retrieving a specific order given its id, and then I focused on the protected api to distinguish between user and admin api.
	\item[Scapinello Michele] In this project, I contributed to improving the ER schema by raising questions about its structure and connecting it to the functionalities that our application needed to include.
								I developed DAO objects such as ListCarDAO, ListCircuitDAO, and ListOrdersByEmailDAO, along with their corresponding servlets ListCarServlet, ListCircuitServlet, ListOrdersByEmailServlet, and LoadCircuitImageServlet.
	Additionally, I created the associated JSP files, such as list-car.jsp, list-circuit.jsp, and list-orders.jsp. Following the introduction of the REST paradigm, I also developed the ListCarsRR and ListCircuitsRR resources and handled their invocation within the RestDispatcherServlet.
	I partially contributed, along with other team members, to implementing JavaDoc where necessary and addressing any general issues.
	In the report, I contributed to the Presentation Logic Layer section and the Business Logic Layer section.
