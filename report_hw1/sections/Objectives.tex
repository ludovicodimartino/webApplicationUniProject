The goal of this project is the development of WaCar, a web application designed to facilitate the booking process for car racing sessions across different tracks in Italy.
WaCar targets both racing enthusiasts and casual users looking for a exciting track experience.
Its primary objective is to provide users with a smooth experience in selecting their desired car, track, number of laps, and booking time slots.
Additionally, the platform also offers administrators the ability to efficiently manage tracks, cars, pricing, and time slots.
