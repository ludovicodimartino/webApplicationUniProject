\subsection{Other Information}

An account that has type "USER" can perform INSERT, UPDATE AND DELETE an order or favourite list item via the interface. It can also perform the UPDATE on the account table to change the values of its attributes. An account of type "ADMIN" can do the above operations plus the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on the circuit and car tables. Additionally, it can do the same operation in carType and circuitType, but in this case the deletions are of type DELETE CASCADE. Finally, it can INSERT and DELETE a new relation between carType and circuitType.

If ad admin removes a circuit or a car, all the foreign key in the order table referring to the removed key become null, so the account can see if its order is still valid or not, and in the latter case it must perfrom an UPDATE to make it valid again.

When an account does an INSERT operation in order table and in the favourite table, a funcion is activate and checks if the circuit type and the car type are compatible with each other. This is performed by checking whether a row exists in carCircuitSuitability table which refers to the selected types. If the function returns a positive result, then the insertion is performed.
