WaCar is an intuitive online platform catering to two primary user groups: users and administrators . Upon entering on WaCar's homepage, users are greeted with an array of features and options designed to streamline their experience. Firstly, users can see a comprehensive list of available cars and circuits, each accompanied by detailed descriptions to help them in their selection process. At the same time they are also presented with the option to either login or register on the platform, providing essential details like name, surname, address, email, and password in order to access to the platform's full set of features.

Once registered, users can seamlessly proceed to place orders through a dedicated subsection of the application. Here, users can select their desired car from various categories, ranging from supercars to off-road vehicles, with each category offering a diverse range of brands and models. Following car selection, users then choose a compatible circuit and specify the number of laps for their session.

The next step involves selecting a suitable time slot from the available options. Once a preferred time slot is chosen, users are presented with a preview of their order, affording them the opportunity to confirm or cancel the booking as desired. Additionally, users have the capability to manage their orders, including the option to delete them, and access a comprehensive history of past orders for reference purposes.

Furthermore, users can mark favorite combinations of circuits and cars for an easier access in the future, ensuring their preferred selections to be accessible during the next visits to the platform.
On the administrative side, administrators oversee the management of tracks and cars, with responsibilities including adding, removing, and modifying them as needed. Administrators are also able to adjust pricing for laps and to associate specific cars with particular circuits, determining which cars can operate on which circuits.
